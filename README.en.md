TW-Thesis provides a [Typst](https://typst.app) template for master's and doctoral theses at major universities in Taiwan. It includes format presets for 15 schools. The tutorial is also a working sample thesis, so you can compile it, copy what you need, and change it into your own thesis.

> **Disclaimer**: The format presets in this template are for reference only. Always follow your school's official thesis regulations and your department's requirements.

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to go from nothing to your first PDF. It takes about ten minutes.

### Install Typst

Choose one method for your system. `brew`, `winget` and `cargo` need to be installed first.

```bash
brew install typst                # macOS
winget install --id Typst.Typst   # Windows
cargo install --locked typst-cli  # any platform
```

After installing, check that it works:

```bash
typst --version
```

This template was developed and tested with Typst 0.15, so we recommend using the same version or a newer one.

### Get the project

This repository is a GitHub **template repository**. Please use **Use this template** to create your own thesis project:

1. Click the green **Use this template** button at the top right, then choose **Create a new repository**.
2. Enter a name for the project (for example, `my-thesis`). We recommend setting the visibility to **Private**.
3. When the repository is created, clone it to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/my-thesis.git
cd my-thesis
```

If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), one command creates the repository and clones it:

```bash
gh repo create my-thesis --template TW-Thesis/tw-thesis-typ --private --clone
cd my-thesis
```

A project created from a template is a **brand-new repository**. It has only one initial commit, does not contain the template's history, and is not linked to this repository. Later updates to the template are not applied to your project automatically. When you want them, you can compare with the new version and copy over the parts you need.

If you do not use GitHub, you can also choose **Code → Download ZIP** on this page and unzip it.

Run all the commands below from the **project root**, which is the folder that contains both `main.typ` and `config.yml`.

### Compile

Once you have the project on your computer, try compiling it:

```bash
typst compile main.typ --font-path fonts/
```

A `main.pdf` file will appear in the project root. Open it and check that the cover page, the table of contents and the body text all display correctly, including the Chinese and English fonts.

- `--font-path fonts/` tells Typst to use the fonts that come with the project (EB Garamond, Tinos and the Ministry of Education Standard Kai typeface), so you do not need to install them on your system.
- **You need an internet connection the first time you compile.** The template downloads a few Typst packages (`kouhu` and `ipsum`, which provide the sample text). They are cached afterwards, so later compilations work offline.
- If you see the warning `unknown font family: dfkai-sb`, you can ignore it. It refers to a backup font and does not affect the result.

### Fill in your information

Open `config.yml` in any text editor. Replace the title, name, department and date with your own, and uncomment the `school` line with your school's code:

```yaml
school: nccu              # uses schools/nccu.yml; see "Supported schools" below

title: "Thesis title in Chinese"
title-en: "A Study on Consistency in Distributed Systems"

author: "Author name in Chinese"
author-en: "Wang, Xiao-Ming"
advisor: "Advisor name in Chinese"
advisor-en: "Chen, Da-Wen"

institute: "Department name in Chinese"
institute-en: "Department of Computer Science"

date: "2027-01-15"        # date on the cover, in YYYY-MM-DD format
```

The fields without `-en` hold the Chinese text, so replace the placeholders above with your Chinese title, name, advisor and department. The fields ending in `-en` hold the English text. Fill in both, or the cover page will be missing one of the languages. Compile again and check the cover page and the verification page. When you choose a school, the format (margins, font sizes, cover style and so on) follows that school's preset. If you do not choose one, the default format is used.

If you want to change a setting that the school preset does not cover, for example setting only the top margin to 3.5 cm, just write it in `config.yml`. It has the highest priority, so you do not have to edit anything in `schools/`. Every available setting and its unit is documented in `schools/default.yml`.

### Write your thesis

The content of your thesis is in `contents/`, organised like this:

```text
contents/
├── front/           abstract, acknowledgements, list of symbols, etc.
├── chapter01.typ    the chapters start here
├── chapter02.typ
├── chapter03.typ
├── chapter04.typ
├── back/            appendices and the bibliography
└── i18n/en/         English version of the tutorial
```

When you first copy the project, these files contain the tutorial. They are also examples you can learn from.

The order of the chapters is set in `main.typ`. To add or remove a chapter, add or delete the matching `#include` line:

```typ
#include "contents/chapter01.typ"
#include "contents/chapter02.typ"
```

References go in `contents/back/references.bib`. In the text, cite an entry by its key. For example, `references.bib` contains an entry called `kocher99`:

```typ
#cp("kocher99")
```

The English version of the tutorial is in `contents/i18n/en/`. It is provided for reading only and is not compiled into your thesis.

### Edit and preview

If you want to see the result while you write, use watch mode. The PDF is rebuilt every time you save a file:

```bash
typst watch main.typ --font-path fonts/
```

If you use VS Code, install the [Tinymist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension to preview the document directly. The project already includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the main file and the font path, so you only need to open the folder.

If your school requires a watermark when you submit, first set the watermark image in the configuration file (this is explained in Chapter 2 of the tutorial), then compile with the following command:

```bash
typst compile main.typ --font-path fonts/ --input watermark=true
```

If you have [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, the commands above can be shortened to:

```bash
just compile   # normal build
just watch     # rebuild every time you save
just release   # build with the watermark
just clean     # delete main.pdf
```
